    4.  She optionally adds a relevant image or a video clip.
    5.  She selects a category for the question (e.g., Cell Division, Genetics).
    6.  She posts the question.
    7.  The question is displayed in the question feed, showing:
        *   Question text
        *   Date posted
        *   Poster's name (Alice)
    8.  A notification is not sent to all users, only users actively following the question tag or course related to question.
    9.  Another user, "Bob," who is knowledgeable about Cell Biology, sees Alice's question.
    10. Bob clicks on the question.
    11. Bob types an answer: "Mitosis results in two identical daughter cells, while meiosis results in four genetically different daughter cells."
    12. (Optional) Bob can include a link to a helpful video or relevant notes.

**7. Future Considerations:**

*   Gamification: Further expand the reward system with leaderboards, challenges, and levels.
*   Personalized Learning:  Use machine learning to recommend courses and content based on user interests and learning styles.
*   Mobile App:  Develop native mobile apps for iOS and Android.
*   Integration with other learning platforms: Allow users to import and export content from other platforms.
